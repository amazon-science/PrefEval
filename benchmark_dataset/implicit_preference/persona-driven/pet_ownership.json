Another effective exercise is \"Devil's Advocate,\" where students argue against their own positions. As for managing stress, teaching breathing techniques, positive self-talk, and visualization can be helpful. Encourage students to prepare thoroughly, as confidence often comes from being well-prepared. Regular mock debates can also help students become more comfortable with high-pressure situations.

Add a comfortable bed, some toys, and perhaps even a white noise machine to further mask garage sounds. This retreat will give your dog a safe space to relax when the noise levels peak. It's also a good idea to introduce your dog to this area with positive reinforcement, so they associate it with comfort and safety.

                "assistant": "Converting a corner of your office area is a smart choice. It's already separate and likely quieter than the main work area. For gradually introducing a new dog to the garage environment:\n\n1. Start with short visits when the garage is quiet.\n2. Use positive reinforcement with treats and praise.\n3. Slowly increase exposure time and noise levels.\n4. Let the dog explore at their own pace.\n5. Create positive associations by playing or offering treats during garage time.\n6. Use a leash initially for safety and control.\n7. Establish a routine for garage visits.\n\nRemember, each dog adapts differently, so be patient and attentive to your new companion's reactions.

                "assistant": "It's great that you're thinking about safety! With a dog in your garage, you'll need to be extra vigilant about several hazards:\n\n1. Chemicals and fluids: Ensure all automotive fluids, solvents, and cleaning products are securely stored out of reach.\n2. Sharp tools and parts: Keep tools organized and put away when not in use.\n3. Hot surfaces: Be cautious with recently run engines, welding equipment, or other heat sources.\n4. Moving vehicles: Always check the dog's location before moving cars.\n5. Falling objects: Secure items on shelves or workbenches.\n6. Small parts: Be careful not to drop nuts, bolts, or other small items that a dog might swallow.\n7. Electrical cords: Keep them organized and out of chewing reach.\n\nConsider creating a checklist for a quick safety sweep before bringing your dog in.

Consistency is key, so try to establish a routine for feeding, walks, and playtime when you are home.

Many busy professionals successfully care for dogs with the help of services like dog walkers and daycare. These can be great options for ensuring your dog gets attention and exercise while you're working. However, if you're concerned about the time commitment, you might also consider a more independent pet like a cat, which can be a loving companion but generally requires less hands-on care. Ultimately, it depends on your lifestyle and how much you're willing to adjust. Have you considered fostering a dog first to see how it fits with your schedule?"

Upper limb rehabilitation: VR games encourage patients to perform repetitive arm movements, making therapy more engaging.\n\n3. Pain management: VR distraction techniques have shown promise in reducing pain perception during exercises.\n\n4. Sports-specific training: Athletes can practice sport-specific movements in a controlled, virtual environment.\n\n5.
