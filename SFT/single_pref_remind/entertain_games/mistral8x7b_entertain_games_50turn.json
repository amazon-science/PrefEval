They can sometimes feel like a way for developers to squeeze more money out of players, even after they've already paid for the game. This can be especially annoying if the microtransactions are for items or advantages that are necessary to fully enjoy the game.\n\nThat being said, it's important to remember that not all microtransactions are created equal. Some games offer optional cosmetic items or additional content that can enhance the gameplay experience without giving an unfair advantage to those who are willing to spend more money.
