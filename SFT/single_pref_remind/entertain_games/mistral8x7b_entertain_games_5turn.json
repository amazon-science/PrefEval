        "response_to_pref": " I understand where you're coming from. Microtransactions and in-game purchases can be frustrating for many gamers. They can sometimes feel like a way for developers to squeeze more money out of players, even after they've already paid for the game. This can be especially annoying if the microtransactions are for items or advantages that are necessary to fully enjoy the game.\n\nThat being said, it's important to remember that not all microtransactions are created equal. Some games offer optional cosmetic items or additional content that can enhance the gameplay experience without giving an unfair advantage to those who are willing to spend more money. However, other games may use microtransactions to create a \"pay-to-win\" environment, where players who are willing to spend more money have a significant advantage over those who don't.\n\nIf you're looking to avoid games with microtransactions or in-game purchases, there are a few things you can do. First, you can research a game before you buy it to see if it includes microtransactions and what those microtransactions entail.
