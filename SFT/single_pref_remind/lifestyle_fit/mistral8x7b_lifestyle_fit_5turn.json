Use sunscreen: Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 on all exposed skin, even on cloudy days. Reapply every two hours and after swimming or sweating.\n\n3. Wear protective clothing: Long-sleeved shirts, long pants, wide-brimmed hats and sunglasses can provide an extra layer of protection. There are also clothing items available that are specifically designed to provide sun protection.\n\n4. Seek shade: When you're outside, try to stay in the shade as much as possible. Be aware, however, that UV rays can still reach you indirectly, so it's important to use other forms of sun protection as well.",
