These sunscreens contain mineral ingredients like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, which work by physically blocking and scattering UV rays. They are often referred to as \"natural\" or \"physical\" sunscreens.\n\nWhen choosing a physical sunscreen, look for one that is broad-spectrum, meaning it protects against both UVA and UVB rays, and has an SPF of at least 30.

Similarly, natural fibers in makeup brushes, such as goat or squirrel hair, can provide a softer touch and more even application of makeup.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that not all synthetic fibers are created equal, and some can be just as gentle and effective as natural fibers. It ultimately comes down to personal preference and what works best for your individual needs and skin or hair type.\n\nRegardless of whether you choose natural or synthetic fibers, it's important to clean your beauty tools regularly to prevent the buildup of dirt, oil, and bacteria, which can lead to skin irritation and other issues.",
