It ultimately comes down to personal preference and what works best for your individual needs and skin or hair type.\n\nRegardless of whether you choose natural or synthetic fibers, it's important to clean your beauty tools regularly to prevent the buildup of dirt, oil, and bacteria, which can lead to skin irritation and other issues.",
