Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Coconut oil alternative:\n- Olive oil: A healthier alternative with a lower smoke point, making it less suitable for high-temperature cooking.\n- Avocado oil: A neutral-tasting oil with a high smoke point, ideal for high-temperature cooking and frying.\n- Ghee or clarified butter: A lactose-free alternative with a high smoke point, great for saut\u00e9ing, frying, and baking.\n- Other nut oils (e.g., almond, walnut, or hazelnut oil): These can be used for lower-temperature cooking or as a finishing oil",

Chemical sunscreens, also known as chemical UV absorbers, work by absorbing the sun's UV rays and converting them into heat.

These sunscreens contain mineral ingredients like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, which work by physically blocking and scattering UV rays. They are often referred to as \"natural\" or \"physical\" sunscreens.\n\nWhen choosing a physical sunscreen, look for one that contains at least 20% zinc oxide or a combination of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. These ingredients provide broad-spectrum protection against both UVA and UVB rays.\n\nIt's also important to choose a sunscreen with an SPF (Sun Protection Factor) of at least 30, as this will provide sufficient protection against UVB rays.
