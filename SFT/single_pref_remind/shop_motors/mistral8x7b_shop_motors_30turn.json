        "response_to_pref": " It sounds like you enjoy having more control over your driving experience, which is one of the main advantages of manual transmissions. Manual transmissions, also known as stick shifts or manual gearboxes, allow drivers to manually select each gear using a clutch pedal and a gear stick. This can provide a more engaging and tactile driving experience compared to automatic transmissions, which shift gears automatically using a torque converter or a dual-clutch system.\n\nManual transmissions can also offer better fuel efficiency and a lower cost compared to automatic transmissions. This is because manual transmissions are generally simpler and lighter in design, which can lead to better fuel economy and a lower sticker price.\n\nHowever, manual transmissions can be more challenging to learn to use, and they may not be as convenient or easy to operate as automatic transmissions, especially in heavy traffic or in hilly terrain. Automatic transmissions have become increasingly sophisticated in recent years, with many models offering smooth and responsive performance, as well as features like paddle shifters that allow drivers to manually shift gears if they choose to.\n\nUltimately, the choice between a manual and an automatic transmission comes down to personal preference",
