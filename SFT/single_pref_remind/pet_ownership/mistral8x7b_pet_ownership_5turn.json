By adopting, you're not only providing a home to an animal in need, but you're also helping to combat the issue of overpopulation in animal shelters.\n\nMany animals in shelters are already house-trained, vaccinated, and spayed or neutered, which can save you time and money. Additionally, shelter staff can often provide valuable insight into an animal's personality and behavior, helping you find a pet that's a good match for you and your lifestyle.\n\nFurthermore, supporting animal shelters also helps to fund the important work they do in caring for animals, providing medical treatment, and working to find them forever homes. By adopting from a shelter, you're contributing to this vital cause and helping to make a positive impact on the lives of animals in your community.\n\nIn contrast, purchasing pets from breeders can contribute to the problem of overbreeding, which can lead to health issues and unwanted animals ending up in shelters.

Vaccinations work by exposing your pet's immune system to a small, harmless part of a virus or bacteria, which triggers their immune system to produce antibodies to fight off the infection.

Other vaccines may be recommended based on your pet's lifestyle, age, and overall health.\n\nWhile it is true that vaccines carry a small risk of side effects, the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks.
