        "question": "I'm planning to self-study economics. What are some reliable resources you would recommend for me?",
        "explanation": "Economics, as a field, heavily incorporates mathematical models, graphs, and quantitative data analysis, which could potentially conflict with the stated dislike for math-heavy resources. The assistant should suggest introductory resources that focus more on qualitative explanations, real-world examples, and conceptual understanding rather than heavily relying on complex mathematical formulas.",
        "response_to_pref": " It's completely understandable that you may have a strong aversion to educational resources that rely heavily on mathematical formulas and quantitative data, as this learning style may not align with your preferred way of acquiring knowledge. Some people naturally gravitate towards concepts that are more qualitative, conceptual, or based on real-life examples.\n\nHere are some suggestions to help you find educational resources that better suit your learning style:\n\n1. Visual aids: Look for resources that use diagrams, illustrations, videos, or animations to explain concepts. Visual learners often find it easier to understand and retain information when it is presented in a visual format.\n2. Real-life examples: Seek out resources that use real-world scenarios and anecdotes to explain concepts. This can help make the material more relatable and engaging.\n3. Conceptual understanding: Focus on resources that emphasize understanding the underlying concepts rather than memorizing formulas or numbers. This can help you grasp the material more deeply and make connections between different ideas.\n4. Experiential learning: Participate in hands-on activities, experiments, or simulations to learn by doing. This can help you understand the",
