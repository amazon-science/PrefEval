        "response_to_pref": " It's completely fine to have your own musical preferences and not enjoy mainstream pop music. Music is a personal experience and it's important to listen to what resonates with you. However, it's also important to remember that music, like any form of art, is subjective and what one person finds vapid, another person might find enjoyable and meaningful.\n\nMainstream pop music is often commercialized because it's created with the intention of appealing to a wide audience and becoming popular. This doesn't necessarily mean that the music lacks depth or artistic merit. There are many mainstream pop artists who are talented songwriters and musicians, and who create music that speaks to people on a deep level.\n\nThat being said, if you're not enjoying mainstream pop music, there are plenty of other genres and artists to explore.

Fiona Apple - Fetch the Bolt Cutters: Fiona Apple is a veteran singer-songwriter known for her powerful voice and poetic lyrics.

While there are many talented and dedicated independent authors out there, there are also many who may not have had access to the same level of editing, proofreading, or design resources as traditionally published authors. As a result, some independently published books may have lower production values or more errors than traditionally published books.\n\nThat being said, there are many resources available to help independent authors produce high-quality books, and many self-published authors take great care to ensure that their work is professionally edited, formatted, and designed.
