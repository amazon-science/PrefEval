This doesn't necessarily mean that the music lacks depth or artistic merit. There are many mainstream pop artists who are talented songwriters and musicians, and who create music that speaks to people on a deep level.\n\nThat being said, if you're not enjoying mainstream pop music, there are plenty of other genres and artists to explore.
