Music is a personal experience and it's important to listen to what resonates with you. However, it's also important to remember that music, like any form of art, is subjective and what one person finds vapid, another person might find enjoyable and meaningful.\n\nMainstream pop music is often commercialized because it's created with the intention of appealing to a wide audience and becoming popular. This doesn't necessarily mean that the music lacks depth or artistic merit. There are many mainstream pop artists who are talented songwriters and musicians, and who create music that speaks to people on a deep level.\n\nThat being said, if you're not enjoying mainstream pop music, there are plenty of other genres and artists to explore.

The band's use of unconventional instruments and global influences make for a listening experience that's both engaging and transportive.\n2. \"Colors\" by Black Pumas - This soul/R&B duo from Austin, Texas has been gaining a lot of buzz in recent years for their vintage sound and powerful live performances. Their debut album, \"Colors,\" is a must-listen for fans of classic soul music.\n3. \"III\" by Banks - This album showcases Banks' haunting vocals and introspective lyrics, set against a backdrop of dark, atmospheric production. If you're a fan of artists like FKA twigs or The Weeknd, you might enjoy Banks' unique take on R&B and electronic music.\n"

As a result, some independently published books may have lower production values or more errors than traditionally published books.\n\nThat being said, there are many resources available to help independent authors produce high-quality books, and many self-published authors take great care to ensure that their work is professionally edited, formatted, and designed.

The magic in this book is subtle and often described in metaphorical terms, making it a great choice for readers who prefer a more understated approach to fantasy.\n2. \"The Golem and the Jinni\" by Helene Wecker - This is a historical fantasy novel set in late 19th-century New York City. It features two magical creatures - a golem and a jinni - who must navigate the human world and learn to coexist. The magic in this book is woven into the fabric of the story, rather than taking center stage.\n3. \"The City We Became\" by N.K.
