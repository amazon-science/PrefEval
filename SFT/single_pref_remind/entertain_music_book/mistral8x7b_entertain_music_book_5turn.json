This doesn't necessarily mean that the music lacks depth or artistic merit. There are many mainstream pop artists who are talented songwriters and musicians, and who create music that speaks to people on a deep level.\n\nThat being said, if you're not enjoying mainstream pop music, there are plenty of other genres and artists to explore.

As a result, some independently published books may have lower production values or more errors than traditionally published books.\n\nThat being said, there are many resources available to help independent authors produce high-quality books, and many self-published authors take great care to ensure that their work is professionally edited, formatted, and designed.
